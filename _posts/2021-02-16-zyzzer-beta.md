## Description
Zyzzer is a fun and engaging way to learn times tables. It allows learners like you from all over the world to compete against each other. To do so, you not only need to do the multiplications in your head but also pay close attention to what your opponent is doing. If you are quick and catch them make a mistake, you can press the Zyzzer and they will have to pay a penalty!

## Gameplay
<img src="/assets/img/zyzzer-0.9.17/board.png" alt="Roll Player Board" width="400"/>  
This is your board. On it, there are 20 numbers. The numbers are all green at the beginning of each game. Your opponent has the same numbers on their board. Each player turns one number grey when it's their turn as outlined below, or they can pass if they cannot find anything to play. The goal is to turn all the numbers grey. First player to do so wins the game.

### When it's your turn:
1. Roll the dice. <img src="/assets/img/zyzzer-0.9.17/throwdice.png" alt="Roll Dice Button" width="40"/>
2. Decide on what you're going to play. (In no particular order)
   * Sum up the dice. For instance, if you roll a `2` and a `3`, your sum is 2 + 3 = `5`
      1. If either one of the dice is a `STAR` (<img src="/assets/img/zyzzer-0.9.17/dice6.png" alt="Roll Dice Button" width="25"/>), that means you get to pick which number from 1 to 5 that die is. For instance, if you roll a `4` and a `STAR`, you can pick any `Sum` from `5` to `9`. Similarly, if you roll double `STAR`s you can pick any `Sum` from `2` to `10`.
      2. If neither is a six, they will be summed up for you automatically.
   * Pick any `Multiplier` from `1` to `10`. 
   * Pick the corresponding `Product` from your board.

3. Press the `Speak Button`. <img src="/assets/img/zyzzer-0.9.17/speak.png" alt="Speak Button" width="40"/>
   1. This is when your opponent might object to your play. See below, for details.
4. If you rolled doubles (`1` and `1`, `STAR` and `STAR`, etc), you play again. Otherwise, it's your opponent's turn.

### When it's you opponent's turn:

You should always pay attention to what your opponent is doing. If you're not careful, they can get away with wrong multiplications.

While your opponent is making up their mind, you can see what the `Sum`, `Multiplier` and `Product` they are planning to play.

Once they press their `Speak Button` you have 5 seconds object if you think they made a mistake by pressing the `Zyzzer`. <img src="/assets/img/zyzzer-0.9.17/zyzzer.png" alt="the Zyzzer" width="40"/>

If you were right and they were wrong, that means you made a _legal_ objection. In that case,
1. Your opponent's last play is reverted,
2. You get to select revert an additional number from their board using `the Remove Button`. <img src="/assets/img/zyzzer-0.9.17/remove.png" alt="remove Button" width="40"/>

If you were wrong, that means you made a _illegal_ objection. In that case, they get to revert a number on your board. This also means if they illegally object to _your_ play, then you will get to revert a number on their baord!
